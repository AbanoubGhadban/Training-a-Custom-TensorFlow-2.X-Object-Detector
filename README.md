# Training-a-Custom-TensorFlow-2.x-Object-Detector
Learn how to train a TensorFlow Custom Object Detector with TensorFlow-GPU

This repo is guide to use the newly introduced TensorFlow Object Detection API for training a custom object detector with TensorFlow 2.X versions. The steps mentioned mostly follow this [documentation](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html#), however I have simplified the steps and the process. As of 8/8/2020 I have tested with TensorFlow 2.2.0 to train a model on Windows 10.

I will soon make a YouTube Tutorial which will be posted [here](), and an extremely import step [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT9t2Bug62RDUfSBcPt0Bzg?sub_confirmation=1)!

## The Steps
1. [Installing TensorFlow GPU]()
2. [Preparing Workspace and Anaconda Virtual Environment Directory Structure]()
3. [Gathering and Labeling our Dataset]()
4. [Generating Training Data]()
5. [Configuring the Training Pipeline]()
6. [Training the Model]()
7. [Exporting the Inference Graph]()
8. [Testing out the Finished Model]()

In this repository, I have gathered and labelled my own dataset for my Pill Classification Demo that identifies two types of pills. The training data for this dataset has also been generated, and it's ready for training. If you want to try it out or get some practice with the Object Detection API, you can try training the Pill Classification Model.
